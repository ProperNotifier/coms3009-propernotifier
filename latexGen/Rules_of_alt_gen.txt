Rules for latex generator
1) Everything in a row has some intersection
2) basic characters are placed in order
3) subscript: no spaces, can't have super script
4) superscript: no spaces, no sub-subscript or weird things like that
5) underline: identified as minus with long width (at least 30% of page)
6) only alph-numeric in super
7) normal text must have about the same height
8) items in math equation must not have spaces between them
9) characters with underline must be formatted by user
10) very long - (more than 75% width) get line_divide
11) division... id by long_divide ... look for chars strictly above, strictly bellow, with width intersection
12) sums: pretend they're full size: look for anything bellow, anything above and super/subscript
13) exp and sub are not considered
14) for lond_divide frac: store numerator and denominator: anything above or bellow that still intersect the bar
\frac{H_{k+1} - H_{k}}{k}
